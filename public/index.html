			<p class="body">If you score a TD or kick a field goal, you then click on the "Kick" button to kick the ball to the computer, which will then have possession of the ball.</p>

			<p class="body">When the computer has the ball, you choose either the run defense or pass defense play to simulate the computer's offensive play call.</p>

			<p class="body">PLAYBOOK:<br></br>Goaline Run - higher chance for gaining short yardage, but also higher chance of fumbling.<br></br>Off-tackle - run play offering lower chance of gaining postive yards, but longer positive yardage potential.<br></br>Toss/Sweep - run play with equal chances of big yardage and negative yardage potential.<br></br>Screen Pass - high chance of low yardage gains<br></br>Pass - normal pass play with lower completion percentage, but higher yardage gains<br></br>Pass Long - even lower completion percentage and higher interception risk, but potential for big yardage gains.<br></br>Run Def - When the computer is on offense, this defense protects against the run<br></br>Pass Def - This defense protects against the pass<br></br>*** When it is 4th down and you anticipate the computer punting or attempting a field goal, your defensive options remain Run Def and Pass Def to protect against a 4th down run or pass.</p>
